# Treasure Maze Game with Deep Q Learning

## Introduction
This project is a treasure maze game that incorporates Deep Q Learning using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow. The goal of the game is for an agent to navigate through a maze to find a hidden treasure while avoiding obstacles and collecting rewards. Deep Q Learning is used to train the agent to make optimal decisions based on its environment and maximize its cumulative reward.

## Code Provided
The code provided for this project includes:
1. Maze environment representation: This code defines the maze layout, including walls, obstacles, and the treasure location.
2. Game logic: This code handles the game mechanics, such as moving the agent, checking for collisions, and updating the game state.
3. Reward system: This code assigns rewards to the agent based on its actions and the game state.

## Code Created
In addition to the provided code, the following code was created for this project:
1. Deep Q Learning implementation: This code utilizes the Keras and TensorFlow libraries to implement the Deep Q Learning algorithm. It includes the neural network architecture, experience replay memory, and training process.
2. Agent behavior: This code determines how the agent interacts with the environment based on the Deep Q Network's predictions. It handles actions such as exploration (choosing a random action) and exploitation (choosing the action with the highest predicted Q-value).

## Connection to Computer Science
Computer scientists work in various fields and tackle a wide range of problems. They design algorithms, develop software, and create systems to solve complex problems efficiently. The treasure maze game project incorporates principles from artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning, which are important subfields of computer science.

Reinforcement learning, as demonstrated in this project, is a branch of machine learning that deals with how an agent can learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. It has applications in robotics, game playing, resource management, and more. Deep Q Learning, specifically, combines deep learning with reinforcement learning to handle complex environments and high-dimensional input spaces.

Computer scientists approach problems by following a systematic and logical process. They analyze the problem, break it down into smaller components, and design algorithms or systems to solve each component. They consider factors such as efficiency, scalability, and reliability while developing solutions. This problem-solving approach involves algorithmic thinking, data structures, and computational thinking.

## Ethical Responsibilities
As a computer scientist, you have ethical responsibilities towards the end users and the organizations involved. These responsibilities include:

1. Privacy and data protection: Ensure that user data is handled securely and transparently. Minimize the collection and storage of personally identifiable information unless explicitly necessary for the game's functionality.

2. Fairness and bias: Avoid introducing biases into the game or the learning process that could result in discriminatory behavior or unfair outcomes. Ensure that the game treats all players fairly and does not discriminate based on attributes such as race, gender, or age.

3. Transparency and accountability: Clearly communicate how the game operates, including its rules, mechanics, and potential risks. Take responsibility for any unintended consequences that may arise from the game's behavior or decisions made by the agent.

4. Safety and well-being: Design the game and the agent's behavior to prioritize the safety and well-being of the players. Consider potential risks, such as physical harm or psychological distress, and take appropriate measures to mitigate them.

5. Legal and regulatory compliance: Ensure that the game complies with applicable laws and regulations, such as data protection laws and intellectual property rights. Respect copyrights and trademarks when using any external assets or resources.

By adhering to these ethical responsibilities, you can contribute to the development of responsible and trustworthy technology that benefits society as a whole.
